## What is Breathing Better?

Breathing Better is a mobile application that guides you through pranayamic breathing exercises to improve your mental and physical health. The app features 4 unique breathing exercises as well as a template for you to create and customize your own breathing exercises.

## Background

Throughout my years as a high schooler, a consistent problem I saw among my friends and community was an unhealthy amount of stress. Doing some further research into the topic revealed that it was not an isolated occurrence: According to a 2018 survey, seven out of ten teens in the U.S. (between 13 and 17 years old) have named anxiety or depression as a major problem among their peers in the community. A study the year after found that on a 10-point scale, where normal values for adults are 3.8, American teens rated their stress rate at an average score of 5.8.

Although I also faced a lot of stress as a high schooler, I was fortunate enough to have learned how to relieve that stress from my religious community and family through pranayamic breathing techniques. After doing some research, I found that pranayama was scientifically proven to provide many benefits to both mental and physical health, ranging from reducing stress to improving lung function. I think that one of the greatest problems with stress is that most people who are very stressed simply don't know how to relieve that stress in their daily lives. I created this app in order to help teach and share a practice that was quick, easy, and accessible anywhere.

## What's Next

I'm planning to add even more customization to the app so users can have greater control over how they practice their breathing exercises. This mainly includes adding a custom number of cycles to any of the otherwise preset breathing exercises, as well as allowing the user to create their own description for their custom breathing exercise that includes further details on how to properly practice it.
